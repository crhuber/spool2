<p>In the United States, if you are a device manufacturer or other third party (the "Sponsor") that provides devices to children under the age of 13 that utilize the Spool2, you assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). This means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Spool2 application the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Spool2. Schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm</a>.</p>

<p>Except as provided in the paragraph above, the Spool2 are not for individuals under the age of 13. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to it.</p>

<p>We may, at any time, and without notice, revise this Agreement. If we modify the Terms of Service, we will post the modification on our website, through the Spool2, or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. Prior to each usage of the Spool2, you should review the Terms of Service to determine the current Agreement to which you are bound. For your convenience, we include the effective date of the Agreement at the beginning of the document, so that you can easily ascertain whether it has been updated since the last time you viewed the Terms of Service. Your continued use of the Spool2 constitutes acceptance of this Agreement at the time of each use. If the modified Terms of Service are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Spool2. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this paragraph, no revisions to the Terms of Service will apply to any dispute between you and Spool2 that arose prior to the date of such revision. These Terms of Service may only be modified in writing as set forth in this paragraph, and may not be modified orally.</p>
